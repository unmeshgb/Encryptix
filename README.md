Here is the description of the tasks I've completed for the summer internshiop at Encryptix.
                                                                            TASK-1 
                                                                      NUMBER GUESSING GAME 
I've created a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it & provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.
                                                                            TASK-2
                                                                          CALCULATOR
I've developed a calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division and allows the user to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform.
                                                                            TASK 3
                                                                        TIC-TAC-TOE GAME
I've built a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to play against each other.This game has following features:
Game Board: Create a 3x3 grid as the game board.
Players: Assign "X" and "O" to two players.
Display Board: Show the current state of the board.
Player Input: Prompt the current player to enter their move.
Update Board: Updated the game board with the player's move.
Check for Win: Check if the current player has won.
Check for Draw: Determined if the game is a draw.
Switch Players: Alternated turns between "X" and "O" players.
Display Result: Shown the result of the game (win, draw, or ongoing).
